> 🎉 **The World's First AI Agent for FreeBSD** — Autolycus runs natively on FreeBSD, Linux, and macOS, delivering full terminal execution, file operations, and intelligent automation. An independent project by **Technetia Inc**. Not affiliated with Nous Research or the original Hermes Agent.

**The self-improving AI agent.** It creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on FreeBSD — natively, without emulation or containers.

Use any model you want — A local lmstudio or ollama server, or some hosted services: [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in, not even a way to login or register! We don't keep tabs on what you do, we're busy enough.

## Quick Install

⚠️ **Autolycus runs on FreeBSD, Linux, and macOS.** The automated installer handles OS detection and platform-specific setup.

### Prerequisites

- **Tested platforms:**
  - FreeBSD 14.x / 15.0 (amd64)
  - Linux (amd64) — Arch Linux, Ubuntu
  - Linux (aarch64) — Armbian on Radxa Rock 5B and PostMarketOS on Pinephone Pro validated
  - macOS (reported working, not extensively tested)
- Rust/Cargo installed (`pkg install rust` on FreeBSD, `rustup` on Linux/macOS)
- Python 3.11+ available
- Optional: add a brain to your AI Agent with a persistent database (`pkg install py311-sqlite` on FreeBSD)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/waym0reom3ga/autolycus-agent.git

# Run the install script (POSIX sh compatible)
sh autolycus-agent/scripts/install-autolycus.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Detect your operating system (FreeBSD / Linux / macOS)
2. Install uv via cargo (skips if already present)
3. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.11
4. Install dependencies with OS-appropriate extras (voice excluded on FreeBSD)
5. Set up the `hermes` CLI command in `~/.local/bin`
6. Create config files from templates
7. Sync bundled skills
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Hermes without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The installer handles everything: uv, Python 3.11, Node.js, ripgrep, ffmpeg, **and a portable Git Bash** (MinGit, unpacked to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\git` — no admin required, completely isolated from any system Git install). Hermes uses this bundled Git Bash to run shell commands.

If you already have Git installed, the installer detects it and uses that instead. Otherwise a ~45MB MinGit download is all you need — it won't touch or interfere with any system Git.

> **Android / Termux:** The tested manual path is documented in the [Termux guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux). On Termux, Hermes installs a curated `.[termux]` extra because the full `.[all]` extra currently pulls Android-incompatible voice dependencies.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; WSL2 installs under `~/.hermes` as on Linux. The only Hermes feature that currently needs WSL2 specifically is the browser-based dashboard chat pane (it uses a POSIX PTY — classic CLI and gateway both run natively).

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or restart your terminal)
hermes setup        # configure API keys and model provider
hermes              # start chatting!
```

> **Note:** If you see "Permission denied" when creating the virtual environment, it may be from a previous installation attempt with different ownership. Simply re-run the installer — it will handle it.

### Manual Installation (FreeBSD)

If you prefer to install step by step:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/waym0reom3ga/autolycus-agent.git
cd autolycus-agent

# Build uv from source (~4 minute compile time, no FreeBSD binary available)
cargo install uv
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

# Create virtual environment
uv venv venv --python 3.11

# Activate the virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate
# Or: source venv/bin/activate  # bash/zsh only

# Install dependencies (excluding voice which has no FreeBSD wheels)
uv pip install -e ".[modal,daytona,messaging,cron,cli,dev,tts-premium,slack,honcho,mcp]"

# Add hermes to PATH
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf $(pwd)/venv/bin/hermes ~/.local/bin/hermes
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Optional Dependencies

- **Clipboard tools**: Install xclip for clipboard support (`pkg install xclip`)
- **Voice transcription**: Local STT (faster-whisper) is unavailable on FreeBSD due to missing ctranslate2 wheels. Use cloud-based alternatives by setting `GROQ_API_KEY` or `VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY`.

## Getting Started

```bash
hermes              # Interactive CLI — start a conversation
hermes model        # Choose your LLM provider and model
hermes tools        # Configure which tools are enabled
hermes config set   # Set individual config values
hermes gateway      # Start the messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.)
hermes setup        # Run the full setup wizard (configures everything at once)
hermes claw migrate # Migrate from OpenClaw (if coming from OpenClaw)
hermes update       # Update to the latest version
hermes doctor       # Diagnose any issues
```

📖 **Documentation:** See [Hermes Agent docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) for reference (Autolycus is API-compatible).

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Hermes works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search (Firecrawl), image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
hermes setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `hermes portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

---

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Autolycus has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `hermes`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action | CLI | Messaging platforms |
|---------|-----|---------------------|
| Start chatting | `hermes` | Run `hermes gateway setup` + `hermes gateway start`, then send the bot a message |
| Start fresh conversation | `/new` or `/reset` | `/new` or `/reset` |
| Change model | `/model [provider:model]` | `/model [provider:model]` |
| Set a personality | `/personality [name]` | `/personality [name]` |
| Retry or undo the last turn | `/retry`, `/undo` | `/retry`, `/undo` |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]` |
| Browse skills | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>` |
| Interrupt current work | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message | `/stop` or send a new message |
| Platform-specific status | `/platforms` | `/status`, `/sethome` |

For the full command lists, see the [CLI guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli) and the [Messaging Gateway guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging).

## Migrating from Hermes/OpenClaw

If you're coming from Hermes or OpenClaw, Autolycus can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
